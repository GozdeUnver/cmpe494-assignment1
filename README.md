# How to run the code
You should have an input and a key file. An example input file is present here with the name "inputFile" and key file is "keyFile". 
In the project directory, type these commands on the terminal:<br>
make<br>
java AES e \<keyFile\> \<inputFile\> // For encryption<br>
java AES d \<keyFile\> \<inputFile\> // For decryption
